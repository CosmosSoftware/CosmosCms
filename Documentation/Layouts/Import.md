# Import Layout into Cosmos
The following shows how to import a pre-built layout. If you are not familar Cosmos layouts, please see our [*quick* read about layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/About.md) before continuing.

Several [pre-built layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/StarterLayouts.md) are available to import into Cosmos. Each is open-source and is customizable. Alternatively you can [create your own layout](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md).

Once you install Cosmos and configure it, it will ask for you to import a layout.  You can do so [or create your own](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md).

In this case we are going to import one of the [starter layouts](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/StarterLayouts.md).

There are several to choose from, and each is open-source. Once imported you are free to modify them to your need.

## How to Import
If you install Cosmos for the first time, you may be taken to the "layouts" page. If not, click on the "Menu" button then "Layouts."

Next, click the button "Import Layouts." 

Now you should see a web page with the list of available layouts. You'll see a screen shot, a name and license, and a description. When ready click "Import."

IMPORTANT! If you already have a "default" layout, this does not replace it. I just adds a layout to the list available to your website.

## Edit/Customize Layout
Once imported you may want to customize it for your needs.  You can edit the layout using the code editor. See the [create layout](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Layouts/Create.md) for information on how to customize.
