# Create and Edit Content

Three paths are availble for creating content that can be hosted with Cosmos.  You can use which one(s) work best for you. An overview of each is given here.

## [Code Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/CodeEditor.md)

The code editor allows editing of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and TypeScript using the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which "is the code editor that powers VS Code" ([Monaco Editor, Microsoft, 11 April, 2022](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)).

This editor is best used by software engineers who are developing web pages that are rich JavaScript/CSS/HTML content for Cosmos.

## [HTML Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/WYSIWYG(HTMLEditor).md)

*Non-technical persons* to create and edit content using the [Kendo UI WYSIWYG editor](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/index).  It comes with many functions you may expect with word processors and you can test-drive those functions on the [product documentation website](https://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/editor/all-tools).

## [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/Creating-with-VS-Code.md)

The best means to build web apps is to use Visual Studio Code with npm.  Angular, React, Vue and other applications can be built locally on your desktop computer, then imported into Cosmos for hosting.

Cosmos does not restrict the type of framework used. You can have multiple applications written in different frameworks all hosted on the same website. Choose the "best of breed" for your needs.
