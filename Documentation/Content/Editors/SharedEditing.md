# Shared Editing (multi-user editing)

The HTML and Code editors allow for multiple people to be working on the same web page at a time.  This is how it works:

* Two or more people open the same web page--and the same verions--at the same time.
* One can be using the HTML editor and the others can be using the Code editors.
* The first person to start editing locks the others out.
* Everyone will know who is editing because it is shown in their toolbar as a red message.
* When the first person is done editing, the page is saved and refreshed for all users.
* Also, the locks are cleared for everyone.

# Chat Feature

Everyone logged in to the Editor will have a "Chat" button at the top of every page.  Click this to initiate a group chat with everyone logged in at the moment.
