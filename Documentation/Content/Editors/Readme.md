# Built-in Editors

Cosmos comes with two editors, each of which is briefly described below.

## [Code Editor](https://github.com/CosmosSoftware/Cosmos.Cms/blob/main/Documentation/Content/Editors/CodeEditor.md)

The code editor allows editing of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and TypeScript using the [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/), which "is the code editor that powers VS Code" ([Monaco Editor, Microsoft, 11 April, 2022](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/)).

This editor is best used by software engineers who are developing web pages that are rich JavaScript/CSS/HTML content for Cosmos.
