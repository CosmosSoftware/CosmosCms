# Custom Not Found Page

When a web page isn't found on a website a "not found" result is returned. Web servers often return a generic web page as a result.

Easily create your own custom "not found" page with Cosmos. Here is how:

1. Using the edior, click on the menu button and choose "Pages".
2. Now click the "New Page" button.
3. Create a page with the title "Not Found."
4. Edit the web page with your own content just like any other web page.

Now, anytime a web page is not found, Cosmos will return the "Not Found" page you just created.
